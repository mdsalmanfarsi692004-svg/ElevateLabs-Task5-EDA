# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights using visual and statistical exploration.

## Objectives
- Extract insights using Pandas and Seaborn.
- Visualize relationships using Heatmaps and Pairplots.
- Analyze trends in survival rates based on Age, Class, and Fare.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- **Age Distribution**: The majority of passengers were between 20-30 years old.
- **Fare vs. Survival**: Passengers who paid higher fares had a higher likelihood of survival.
- **Class vs. Age**: First-class passengers were generally older than those in third class.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Task5_Titanic_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to generate the analysis.
